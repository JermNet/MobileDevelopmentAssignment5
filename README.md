# What Is This?
This is my 5th assignment for my Mobile Development course, and the first that combines Mobile Development with Kotlin and Databases. I also added the extra layer of taking the data from a csv file. I go into more detail in the video, but this app gets data from a csv file, saves it to a DB and then uses that plus Kotlin to put it on the screen and make it look nice.
